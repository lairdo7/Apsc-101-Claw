# Automated Object-Sensing Claw (APSC 101)

Arduino-controlled robotic claw that detects nearby objects and automatically grips them using an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor.

## How it works
- Continuously measures distance
- Closes if an object remains within range for a set time
- Reopens once the object is removed
- Includes debounce timing to prevent false triggers

## Hardware
Arduino Uno • HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor • Servo Motor • 3D-printed claw

## Purpose
Built for a first-year engineering design project to demonstrate sensor integration, embedded control, and rapid prototyping.
